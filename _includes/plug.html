                <h2>Have you heard about <strong>Basileia</strong>?</h2>
            </header>
	<p>Basileia is Greek for “kingdom” — the kingdom of God! We’ve named our summer training <strong>Basileia</strong> because we want to deepen our knowledge of Jesus Christ as King and to improve our capacity to be his ambassadors. Basileia is a week-long, multi-track conference designed so that your whole campus fellowship can attend and benefit. Some tracks emphasize leadership training, and other disicipleship. For all, <strong>Basileia</strong> is a time for worshiping God, studying Scripture, deepening your vision, and strengthening your faith.</p>
  <p>It’s a great chance to make friends with fellow Christians from one of the 60 other InterVarsity fellowship in New York and New Jersey.</p>
